## About

This project presents Python implementations of pivotal machine learning models and algorithms, all created from scratch. Our primary focus is not on producing highly optimized or computationally efficient code but rather on delivering transparent and accessible implementations that allow for a comprehensive exploration of these algorithms.

### Key Features:

- **Experiential Learning:** This repository serves as a platform for our personal journey in the realm of machine learning. It provides a space to explore and experiment with a wide array of machine learning models and algorithms.

- **Algorithmic Depth:** Our implementations encompass a diverse range of algorithms, spanning supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and more.

- **Transparency:** Each algorithm is meticulously implemented and thoroughly documented, providing clear insights into their functioning. This resource is designed to facilitate learning and experimentation.

The primary objective of this repository is to foster our personal growth and understanding of machine learning. While it is conceived as a space for personal development, it remains open for others to explore, learn, and potentially collaborate on machine learning projects.

We invite you to delve into the code, run examples, and connect with us if you have questions or ideas to share.

## Algorithms Included

Here's a comprehensive list of machine learning algorithms available in this repository:

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/aayushsoni4/Machine-Learning-Algos-from-Scratch/tree/main/Linear%20Regression) - Linear regression stands as a foundational algorithm for modeling the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is a cornerstone in the domains of machine learning and statistical modeling.

2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/aayushsoni4/Machine-Learning-Algos-from-Scratch/tree/main/Logistic%20Regression) - Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome. It's widely employed in machine learning for tasks such as binary classification and has applications in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and marketing.

Each algorithm is implemented in Python and meticulously documented to facilitate comprehension of both the code and the underlying principles.
